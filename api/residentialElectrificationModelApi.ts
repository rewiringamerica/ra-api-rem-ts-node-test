  /**
   * Predict a user\'s annual savings using the Residential Electrification Model.  This API makes predictions of the energy, emissions, and energy bill changes for an existing home based on the upgrade type, the address of the home being upgraded, and the current heating fuel.  Using the provided address, it first queries a large database of home properties that Rewiring America has assembled, which contains data such as home age, size, construction material, and much more. We don\'t know all of the properties needed to get a good estimate of energy consumption, so we perform a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation over a sample homes chosen from a [conditional probability distribution](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/tree/develop/project_national/housing_characteristics) based the properties that we do know. We then estimate the energy consumption for each sample building by running inference using a Machine Learning based surrogate model, trained on [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) simulations.  The response JSON is a dictionary with three components: - `fuel_results`: This is a dictionary of the main results from the model, one for each heating fuel type,   which are:   - `electricity`   - `fuel_oil`   - `natural_gas`   - `propane`   - `total` (for the total of all the others). - `rates`: A summary of the rates used to calculate the annual cost in dollars of the fuels used. - `emissions_factors`: A summary of the local emissions factors used to calculate annual emissions.   These vary from region to region based on how electricity is generated and the nature of   other fuels.  Within the `fuel_results` subsection for each of the fuel types, there are three components:   - `baseline`: the annual usage of the fuel before the upgrade   - `upgrade`: the annual usage of the fuel after the upgrade   - `delta`: the change is usage of the fuel.  Inside those three, there are parallel structures with statistics for the `energy` used in the form the fuel, the `emissions` associated with the use of the fuel, and  the `cost` of the fuel. The electricity emissions factors are [long run marginal emissions rates assuming a 95% decarbonized grid by 2050](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html). The emissions and costs are computed with the help of the numbers returned in the `rates` and `emissions_factors` data mentioned above, where the costs the reflect the annual costs from volumetric charges and fixed charges. Note that the fixed charges are based on the presense of the given fuel in the baseline scenario, and not assumed to change in the upgrade scenario. All of the statistics are for a full typical weather year. The units for each of the statistics are also provided and are as appropriate for the fuel, emissions, or cost.  If `{SupportedUpgrade.BASELINE_2022_1.value}` is specified as the upgrade in the request, `fuel_results` will exclude `upgrade` and `delta` since baseline represents the home\'s current state without any upgrades.  *A note on statistics*: For each value we provide statistics for, we provide a mean, a median, and the 20th and 80th percentile values over all the set of sample homes in the Monte Carlo simulation. It is important to note that the statistics are taken over the distribution of the values they represent. This means, for example, that the median in terms of electricity usage before the upgrade and the median in terms of electricity usage after the upgrade and the median in terms of change of electricity usage might not be the same, so adding the median change to the median usage before the upgrade might fail to produce the number reported as the median usage after the upgrade.  Note that because we are modeling whole home energy consumption over a set of building samples, and the building set contains homes with a variety of fuels for the non-heating appliances, you may see consumption of fuels other than the passed heating fuel, particularly for the mean.  ### Demonstrations  There are two sample Python notebooks that demonstrate the API in action.  - [REM Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/rewiringamerica/api_demos/blob/main/notebooks/REM%20Demo.ipynb) illustrates   basic API calls. - [All About REM   Statistics.ipynb](https://github.com/rewiringamerica/api_demos/blob/main/notebooks/All%20About%20REM%20Statistics.ipynb)   digs into details on the statistics that the API returns and how they relate to one another in various   circumstances.  If you would like to integrate the REM API into a web site, there is also an example.  - [HTML/JavaScript Demo](https://github.com/rewiringamerica/api_demos/tree/main/www)   illustrates how to call the API from JavaScript on a simple web page. It shows how the   API could be used to allow a web site visitor to enter their address and see how much   they could save by installing a heat pump.  Parameters ---------- upgrade     The upgrade whose effects we want to analyze. address     The full address for a location including street number and name, city, state, and zip code. heating_fuel     The heating fuel used in the home before the upgrade. request     The raw incoming request object.  Returns ------- Savings     An object containing predicted household savings, including `fuel_results`, `rates`, and `emissions_factors`.  Raises ------ HTTPException     If the BuildingProfile finds no housing features for the combination of parameters.
   * @summary Get by address
   * @param upgrade The upgrade whose effects we want to analyze. Supported values are as follows: - `baseline`: Baseline building with no upgrades applied. - `combination__all_electric__hvac_seer24_hspf13__weatherization`: A whole-home upgrade including a high efficiency air source heat pump for the home’s HVAC system, basic weatherization, a heat pump water heater, a heat pump dryer, and an induction stove. HVAC heat pump is SEER 24, HSPF 13 for ducted systems; SEER 29.3, HSPF 14 for ductless systems, heat pump water heater is UEF 3.35-3.45, and heat pump dryer is Combined Energy Factor (CEF) 5.2. Additional details can be found in measure package 9 (on page 9) of [this document](https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2022/EUSS_ResRound1_Technical_Documentation.pdf).  - `combination__hvac_seer18_hspf10__weatherization`: A medium-efficiency heat pump upgrade for the home\'s HVAC system, plus a basic weatherization upgrade. The heat pump is SEER 18, HSPF 10 for ducted systems; SEER 18, HSPF 10.5 for ductless systems. The nominal capacity is sized equal to the larger of heating/cooling design loads, and the heating and cooling are modeled without setpoint setbacks. The basic weatherization component of this upgrade includes attic floor insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, and drill-and-fill insulation. Attic floor insulation levels are upgraded for compliance with IECC-Residential 2021 and range from R-30 to R-60 depending on climate zone. Attic floor insulation only applies to dwelling units with vented attics. Air sealing is performed to reduce ACH50 by 30%, duct sealing is performed to reduce duct leakage to 10%, and a drill-and-fill insulation level of R-13 is applied to uninsulated wood stud walls. Additional details can be found in measure package 1 (on page 4) of [this document](https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2022/EUSS_ResRound1_Technical_Documentation.pdf). - `hvac__heat_pump_seer15_hspf9`: A relatively-low efficiency air source heat pump upgrade for the home’s HVAC system. Heat pump is SEER 15, HSPF 9 for both ducted and ductless systems.Additional details can be found in measure package 3 (on page 5) of [this document](https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2022/EUSS_ResRound1_Technical_Documentation.pdf). - `hvac__heat_pump_seer18_hspf10`: A medium-efficiency heat pump upgrade for the home\'s HVAC system.

Measures include attic floor insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, and drill-and-fill insulation.
